    <h1>What is WHS UNICEF?</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/" target="_blank">WHS UNICEF</a> is a club that resides in Gretchen Whitney High School located in California. They strive to become the voice of UNICEF and UNICEF USA for the teen/student target audience and further advocate for the global mission statement - "for every child". A new theme or humanitarian issue is decided on every month to base service activities and newsletters around it. </p>

    <p>There is a School Supply Drive that is taking place from Tuesday, September 24th to Friday, September 27th. All donations will be donated to a title I elementary school in LA County; Title I schools are schools that consist of students who typically come from low-income families and lack necessities. With that in mind, all donated supplies must be new and donations will be available in the quad during lunch. Every two supplies will equal 0.5 hours, with a max of 2 hours. </p>
